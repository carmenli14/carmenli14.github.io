            <p>
                With its fast shipping, vast selection of products, and generous return policy, Amazon is the 
                top platform when it comes to e-commerce. However, information regarding environmental impact 
                tends to be hidden or overlooked. Our objective was to make design choices that can inspire 
                and allow for more sustainable consumer decisions. With an expected 76.6 million households 
                having a subscription to Amazon Prime in 2022 (Statista), this user base is a ripe opportunity 
                to have a great impact on consumer behavior.

                To reach their goals of making more environmentally-conscious purchasing decisions, 
                consumers need intuitive signals and transparent information about what goes into making and delivering the products. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The promise of fast and free delivery accompanied along with the lack of information about the 
                consequential ecological impact enables online shoppers to easily prioritize convenience over 
                making environmentally conscious decisions.

                To contextualize our problem space, we collected data. We wanted to gain insight on how increasing transparency 
                would affect consumer behavior and sentiment and start honing in on a problem statement. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>surveys</h4>
            <p>
                Our initial method was to deploy a survey to understand users’ feelings and knowledge 
                regarding environmentalism, shopping/delivery preferences, and the likelihood of shifting 
                purchasing decisions. Participants were able to answer using multiple choice, selection, and Likert scales. 
                We were able to garner 71 responses. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>interviews</h4>
            <p>
                To consolidate insight gained from the survey, we also conducted 4 user interviews to capture points in greater detail. 
                The more open-ended nature of interviews provided deeper insight into users and gave them freedom to elaborate. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>core findings</h4>
            <p>
                From our survey and interviews, we narrowed down these core findings: 
            </p>

            <div class="bullet">
                <div class="dot">
                    <p>●</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    80% of participants are Amazon Prime members, with 87% of these members being drawn to the 
                    free/faster shipping options the service provides.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bullet">
                <div class="dot">
                    <p>●</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Amazon is not being transparent enough about their environmental impacts, and feel positively 
                    towards the idea about the inclusion of such information.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bullet">

                <p>
                    While a majority of participants felt relatively strong about environmental issues (approximately 90%), 
                    these feelings don’t translate for questions relating to the impact of their purchasing habits. 
                    It seems that when it comes to shopping, convenience takes precedence over sustainability.

                From our user research, we observed that some participants used Amazon due to its convenience. 
                At the same time, they wanted to make more sustainable consumer decisions but were inhibited by 
                Amazon’s lack of pertinent information and options. We used these responses to craft the specific goals, 
                needs, and possible pain points of the following user personas.

                We conducted thorough competitive analysis to experience first-hand which features work well 
                in accomplishing our goal. The competitors included both commerce brands and environmental/ethical brands.
                Here's a few of the brands we audited and their design approaches.

            <p class="callout" style="font-weight: 400;">
                To meet the needs of the users, we explored four different flows with core functionalities of Amazon. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>flow 1: filter search and product page</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-flow1.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                In this flow, we extend Amazon’s search process to include more sustainability features to filter by. 
                It’s based on all our personas, who express the need for the ability to filter for their desired products. 
                We also add a “product background” section to the individual product pages. This flow provides a solution 
                to our problem statement because the additional information and ability to filter by sustainability would 
                allow users to make informed purchases with greater transparency. 
            </p><br>

            <h4>flow 2: search with eco-mode toggle</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-flow2.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                In this flow, we implement an Eco-mode toggle such that when enabled on the homepage, it changes 
                the featured products to eco-certified products. This is targeted for users who would like to 
                narrow down their search to only certified or “climate pledge friendly” products. 
            </p><br>

            <h4>flow 3: checkout shipping selection</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-flow3.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                In this flow, we focus on redesigning the shipping selection process by adding an “eco-shipping” option. 
                This gives the users the ability to combine shipping, receive items in compostable/recyclable packaging, 
                and select more fuel-efficient transportation methods. Because we are motivated by how Amazon Prime users 
                tend to select the fastest and most convenient option, we believe that providing alternative options would 
                allow environmentally-conscious users across our presented personas to make better shipping decisions. 
            </p><br>

            <h4>flow 4: profile dashboard</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-flow4.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                In this flow, we incorporate more information about a user’s contributions to sustainability on their 
                profile dashboard. The redesigned page will contain personalized data, such as areas of improvement, 
                graphs on impact of their purchases, and tips on how to make more environmentally friendly choices.

        </div>
        <div class="prj-content">

            <p class="callout" style="font-weight: 400;">
                Using these user flows, we consolidated the ideas into sketches and then transformed them into low fidelity prototypes. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>prototype a: homepage and search</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-lofi1.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                For Prototype A, we decided to merge Flow 1 and Flow 2 because both dealt with extending the search process. 
                With the Eco-mode toggle, the homepage will be automatically filtered and users will be presented with a 
                selection of environmentally friendly products to choose from. They are also able to apply filters to search 
                through these products. Thumbnails of items will have a mini leaf icon as indication. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>prototype b: checkout and shipping</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-lofi2.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                Prototype B closely follows Flow 3. In the checkout process, shipping selection takes precedence to 
                emphasize the new “eco” features. Users may opt-in to learn more or customize specific details 
                such as combining shipping and compostable packaging through modal overlays. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>prototype c: profile dashboard</h4>
            <img src="images/amazon-lofi3.png" class="prj-content-img-shadow">
            <p>
                Prototype C closely follows Flow 4. While the user is in Eco-mode, Amazon’s account page will be 
                more geared towards information regarding “green” purchases.

            <p class="callout" style="font-weight: 400;">
                We conducted a round of user testing to determine our next steps in iterating the design. 
                We selected four participants who used Amazon Prime and identified as relatively eco-conscious. 
                For each prototype, we observed how successfully the users performed related tasks and gathered 
                responses on likes, dislikes, suggestions, and whether they would use the presented feature. 
            </p>
            <br>

                <p>4/4 users preferred Prototypes A and B, because there was a sense of familiarity with the functionalities, eliminating the need for onboarding.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Prototype C is a bit less intuitive and the contribution it has on convincing users to make more eco-conscious choices isn’t as direct.</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="bullet">
                <div class="dot">
                    <p>●</p>
                </div>
                <p>There was common sentiment in favor of integrating “Eco-mode” into Amazon rather than having a discrete “Eco-mode”. 
                    In the current prototypes, users must opt-in to a separate mode and this could discourage potential users from 
                    committing themselves to it. </p>
            </div> 
            <br>

            <h4>next steps</h4>
            <p>
                We will iterate on all the prototypes by integrating the “eco” features into the existing Amazon interface 
                because we believe that having a familiar UX could be a more effective and user-friendly approach to 
                encourage more sustainable consumer behavior. Even though users did not express a strong likelihood 
                of using the “eco” dashboard feature as seen in Prototype C, we plan to consider a better way to present 
                this information because allowing users to reflect on their consumer behavior is still a viable feature. 
                There was also confusion as to why certain options exists or what they meant, so we will work on providing 
                accurate labeling and cues for the significance of features.
